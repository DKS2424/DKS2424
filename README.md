Hello coding enthusiasts! Welcome to a simple yet interactive web page demonstration. In this HTML code, we're creating a delightful experience where you can explore the changing moods of a smiley face on a canvas element. Let's dive into the breakdown of this code:

- We start with the essential HTML structure, featuring the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and the `<html>` tag.
- Within the `<head>` section, you'll find JavaScript code enclosed within `<script>` tags. This code defines three crucial functions: `smile()`, `sad()`, and `check()`. These functions are responsible for drawing either a smiling or a sad face on the canvas, as well as toggling between the two expressions when the button is clicked.
- Styling is handled in the CSS section, where we define the appearance of various elements such as the body, canvas, and button. This ensures a visually appealing presentation.
- Moving to the `<body>` section, we utilize the `onload` attribute to call the `smile()` function when the page loads initially. This sets the mood to a smiling face from the start.
- Centered prominently is an `<h1>` heading displaying the title "Smile change Mood," inviting you to engage with the interactive experience.
- Next, we introduce the `<canvas>` element with the id "canvas," where the smiley face is drawn and displayed dynamically.
- A `<button>` element is provided with the text "Change Mood." This button serves as the catalyst for toggling between the smiling and sad expressions, thanks to the `check()` function.
- Additional instructions and guidance are offered through `<h4>` and `<h6>` elements, ensuring a seamless user experience.
